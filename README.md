# Accelerometer_Visualization
In this project, I implemented a Kalman Filter on an stm32 ARM cortex m4 processor and created a visualization to to compare raw and filtered data.

I used the STM32 Cube IDE for the embedded C code which reads data from the accelerometer and computes the estimated state using a Kalman Filter, and have included the source and header files in this repository.  I also used proccesing to create a visualization of the accelerometer data, which included raw and filtered representations.
